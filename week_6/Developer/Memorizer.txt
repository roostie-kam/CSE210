1. Create a Word class that contains a single word and a boolean flag indicating whether 
or not it's masked. (private boolean isMasked = "false")

2.The Scripture class should have a list of Word instances, and randomly masking 
a word should be implemented like this. 

    1.  Choose a random index maskIndex between 0 and the size of the word list 
    wordList.
    2. Mask the word at that index like so: wordList[maskIndex].mask()

3. When rendering the scripture, use: string.Join. (public random maskIndex = "true")
